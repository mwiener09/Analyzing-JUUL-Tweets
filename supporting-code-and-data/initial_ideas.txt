Ideas:

1.	Analyze tweet data to analyze juuling teens and young adults - Similar to design of this opioid study (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs13181-017-0625-5)
	a. Questions of interest:
		i. Which locations and demographic info (to be attached by geolocation/zip code) is juuling most prevalent? 
			1. Has this changed over time (pretty recent, so we maybe can exclude this)?  
		ii. If juuling is mentioned in a tweet, are these mostly related to quitting smoking, or is it more of a novelty?  
		iii. Is juuling referenced in tweets more/less than smoking cigarettes/weed amongst young people?  
		iv.	Are there twitter accounts/hashtags/initiatives against juuling on twitter, and are they effective?
	b. NLP model to classify a tweet if juuling is mentioned in a way where the person is/has used it for recreation, if it’s referenced in a way where it’s helping people stop smoking, or if it’s referenced in a way that people are against it (multiclass classification).
		i. Challenges:
			1. Will sample size be large enough for training, validation, test?
				- Manually need to pull tweets everyday bc free version of twitter API only allows you to go back 7 days, 450 tweets every 15 min
			2. Need to manually label tweets
			3. Video or pics of juuling will be excluding - missing some signal here
			4. No demographic data on tweets
				- For tweets with geolocation/zip, can attach census info about income, # of young people in area, etc
				- Can probably get a pretty solid model from tweets this and then apply model to FB statuses (API?) to gather insights on demographics?
	c.	Limitations/biases: 
			1. Not sure how many high school age are on twitter, study (http://www.pewinternet.org/2018/05/31/teens-social-media-technology-2018/) says 32% - not sure we can facilitate this through any other social media platform (insta or snap would probably be best)
			2. If applying to FB data, may not get insights on younger people because HS are not on FB as much - more skewed to people stopping smoking(?)
